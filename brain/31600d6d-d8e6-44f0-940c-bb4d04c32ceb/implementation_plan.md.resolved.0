# Gas Station Management System - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Develop a web-based Gas Station Management System using Django. The system will handle fuel inventory, pump management, and sales transactions. It will support three user roles: Admin, Operator, and Client.

## User Review Required
- **Database**: Using SQLite for simplicity as per requirements, but code will be compatible with PostgreSQL.
- **Styling**: Using Bootstrap 5 for rapid UI development.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
- Project Name: `gas_station`
- App Name: `core`

### Models (`core/models.py`)
- **User**: Extend `AbstractUser` or use Groups for roles (Admin, Operator, Client).
    - Roles:
        - Admin: Full access (Django Admin).
        - Operator: Can manage pumps and create transactions.
        - Client: Can view personal transaction history.
- **Fuel**:
    - `name` (e.g., A-95, Diesel)
    - `price_per_liter`
    - `stock_quantity`
- **Pump**:
    - `name/number`
    - `fuel_type` (ForeignKey to Fuel)
    - `status` (Available, Busy, Out of Order)
- **Transaction**:
    - `date_time`
    - `pump` (ForeignKey)
    - `fuel` (ForeignKey)
    - `liters`
    - `total_price`
    - `operator` (ForeignKey to User)
    - `client` (ForeignKey to User, optional)

### Views & Templates
- **Auth**: Login, Register (for clients).
- **Dashboard**: Redirects based on role.
- **Operator View**: Select pump, select fuel amount, confirm transaction.
- **Client View**: List of past transactions.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Create users for each role.
- Log in as Operator and perform a transaction.
- Check if fuel stock decreases.
- Log in as Client and verify the transaction appears in history.
- Check Admin panel for full records.

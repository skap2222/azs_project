# Gas Station System Walkthrough

## Overview
The Gas Station Management System has been fully implemented with a modern interface featuring both Light and Dark themes, Ukrainian localization, and dynamic fuel type customization.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Interface (UI/UX)
- **Theme Switcher**: Users can toggle between **Light (Soft)** and **Dark (Neon)** modes via the navbar icon.
- **Dynamic Colors**: Fuel types retain branding colors across themes.
- **Interactive Map**: A new `/map/` page showing station locations with real-time prices.
- **Bonus Shop**: A new `/shop/` page to retrieve rewards.
- **Promotions**: A vibrant `/promotions/` page showcasing current offers.
- **Clean UI**: Simplified pump selection by removing redundant price indicators.
- **Favicon**: Branded gas station icon in the browser tab.

### 2. Backward Logic & Accounts
- **Authentication**: Registration and Login pages.
- **Profiles**: Personal cabinet showing Bonus Balance and Transaction History.
- **History**: Detailed list of past fuelings with date, amount, and bonuses earned.
- **Loyalty System**:
    - **Bonuses**: 1 Liter = 1 Bonus Point.
    - **Coupons**: Transactions >20L trigger a "Free Coffee" reward.
    - **Redemption**: Users can buy Coffee (30) or Hot Dogs (50) in the Shop.

### 3. Backend Logic
- **Models**:
    - [Fuel](file:///C:/Users/kirpo/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/core/models.py#4-16): Includes `color_code`.
    - [Pump](file:///C:/Users/kirpo/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/core/models.py#17-33) & [Transaction](file:///C:/Users/kirpo/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/core/models.py#34-49): Business logic.
    - [Profile](file:///C:/Users/kirpo/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/core/models.py#50-60): Stores user bonus balance, auto-created via signals or `get_or_create`.
- **Map**: Uses Leaflet.js with Dark Matter tiles.
